This is the implemetation of fine tuning a neural network that predicts alzheimers disease.

screenshots folder has the plots for 1 layer, and many layers with L2.
screenshots_l1 folder has the plots for many layers with L1.
alzheimers_prediction is the main code while the other py files are for either running for specific parameters or testing the results that are in mongoDB.
if you  dont use mongoDB you cant see the results compared to plots.
